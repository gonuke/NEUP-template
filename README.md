This package contains template LaTeX files to generate the following 4 files
for an NEUP submission:

* abstract.tex : Technical Abstract
* benefits_of_collaboration.tex : Benefits of Collaboration

The following files are also used:

  package; populated with USDOE acronym

The following files should not need to be changed unless you want to alter the
template:
